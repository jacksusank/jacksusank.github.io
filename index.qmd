Hi, I'm Jack Susank and welcome to my website! I'm a 3rd year computer science student at Pomona College with a passion for problem-solving, AI, and technology. Recently, I've been looking into Natural Language Processing (NLP), 3D Rendering/Printing, Data Visualization, and App Building. When Iâ€™m not working, studying, or learning about these things, I enjoy hiking, cooking, playing football, and spending time with my friends and family.

Thanks for visiting my site! Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch!
